## What is this

This is the repo for the INFO381 group DeepFakes.
Here you will find our dataset(gender_modified.csv) and training models(models/trained) as described in our report.


## How to load training models

In accordance with scikit's recommendations we used ```joblib``` to dump our training models to a file.

Go to page 618 of [this documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable//_downloads/scikit-learn-docs.pdf#page=624) 
to view how to load these files into classifiers that can be used again.
